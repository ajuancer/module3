    <h1>Data Selfie App + Weather Here App = Selfying the weather</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the home page of the <b>Data Selfie App</b>, or at least, a <b>part of it</b>. Now it's combined with the next module about APIs and data in JS. As a result, you're going to find out the combined version of the ideas. <br><br>They're based on the work of <a href="https://github.com/joeyklee">Joey Lee</a> and taught by <a href="https://github.com/shiffman">Daniel Shiffman</a>. Some more ideas are added thanks, mainly, by about 5,000,000 pages on <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>. Hope you like it! <br><br>You can see all the project hosted on <a href="https://www.github.com/ajuancer/selfying-the-weather">my Github.</a></p>

<p>The project has two pages:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/add"><b>add</b>/</a> - where you can add values to the database.</li>
    <li><a href="/all"><b>all</b>/</a> - where you can see all the data.</li>
</ul>
<p style="display: inline;">Some improvements to be made (<p style="color: red; display: inline;">that you should know before using this app</p>):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Require the data, because currently you can add an item to the database without coordinates or an image.</li>
    <li>Add some kind of animation while the sent data is being using to catch the weather info, because the app looks like is not working until the results are displayed.</li>
    <li>Display the draw window when the add page loads, currently you need to select camera and then the canvas back.</li>
</ul>
<p class="final">A demo of the project (hopefully) is available at <a href="https://selfying-the-weather.herokuapp.com">selfying-the-weather.herokuapp.com</a>.<br>Feel free to make a pull request with these improvements, i don't pretend to fix them in any time soonðŸ˜‚ </p>
